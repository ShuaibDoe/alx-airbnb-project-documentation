#  Airbnb Clone — User Stories

##  Overview
This section documents **user stories** derived from the **Use Case Diagram (Task 1)** for the Airbnb Clone backend project.  
User stories describe what each actor (Guest, Host, Admin) wants to achieve within the system and why, ensuring the system is built from a user-centered perspective.

---

##  Objective
Convert system interactions into **user stories** that:
- Capture key user goals.
- Define expected outcomes.
- Guide the development of backend features.

---

##  Purpose of User Stories
User stories bridge the gap between **use case diagrams** and **technical implementation**.  
They ensure that every backend feature aligns with real-world user needs and business goals.
